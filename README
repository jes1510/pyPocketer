The programm will generate G-Code that will mill in the positive directions for X and Y.  The position of the tool is decremented for a pocket mill so it is assumed that the tool will move in the negative direction for the Z axis.  The top of the workpiece is assumed to be the zero position.

units:	
Units of measurement.  Either Imperial (USA) or metric (Rest of the world)

X Dimension:
X Dimension of area to be milled

Y Dimension:
Y Dimension of area to be milled

Tool Diameter:
Diameter of tool to be used for milling

Overlap %:
Amount each pass should overlap the previous pass.  Expressed in percentages.  0 in this box will use no overlap.  Use more overlap for cleaner cuts

Z Liftoff Height:
Height to lift Z axis that will clear entire work area

Final depth:
Final depth of milled pocket. If this value is less than the Max Step Depth then only one pass will be generated

Max Step Depth:
Amount to decrement the Z axis for the milling motion

Feed Rate:
Feedrate per minute per a standard "F" code.  Imches per minute for Imperial and mm per minute for metric

Preferred Direction:	The program will generate code that will move on one long axis and increment on the shorter axis.  It is assumed that for a rectangular work area that the direction preference should be on the longer axis and is calculated by the "Auto" value.  It can be overridden by directly selecting an axis in the box.  Keep in mind that this may not be particularly efficient but it may be desirable in some circumstances.

Use Tool Offset:
Calculates all moves so that the outside edge of the tool is within the specified X and Y coordinates.  If checked, the first move will be in the preferred direction for a distance equal to the radius of the tool.  The tool will then be lowered into the workpiece.  This means that the outside edge of the pocket will be underneath the center of the cutting tool when the G-Code is ran so zero will be at the edge of the pocket If this option is not checked then an absolute tool path will be calculated that does not take the tool size into account.  This will cause the pocket to be larger than the specified dimensions by a quantity equal to the tool diameter.

Output Filename: 
Name of file to be written

"Write to file button":
Takes all values and generates the G-Code which is then written to the file
